This Service Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between TechCorp Inc. ("Provider") and Client Solutions LLC ("Client") effective as of January 1, 2024.

1. TERM AND TERMINATION
This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of twelve (12) months. The Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.

Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within ten (10) business days after receiving written notice of the breach.

2. PAYMENT TERMS
Client shall pay Provider a monthly fee of $5,000 within fifteen (15) days of invoice receipt. Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate of 2.5% per month, compounded monthly. Provider reserves the right to suspend services immediately upon any payment default.

All fees are non-refundable and non-cancellable once services commence. Client acknowledges that Provider has incurred significant setup costs and that early termination would result in substantial financial loss to Provider.

Each party agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary and confidential information disclosed by the other party. This obligation shall survive termination of this Agreement and continue for a period of five (5) years.

Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, business plans, customer lists, technical specifications, pricing information, and any other information marked as confidential or which should reasonably be understood to be confidential.

IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.

Provider's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid by Client to Provider in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to such liability.

5. INDEMNIFICATION
Client shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Provider from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to Client's use of the services, violation of this Agreement, or infringement of any third-party rights.

This indemnification obligation shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall not be subject to any limitation of liability provisions contained herein.

6. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
Provider may collect, store, and process personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Client grants Provider a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute any data provided by Client for any purpose, including commercial use.
